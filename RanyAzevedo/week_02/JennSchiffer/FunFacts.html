      <h2> FunFacts!</h2>

      <p> She is an artist and sells her
      <a href="https://society6.com/jennmoneydollars/collection/nude-woman-1" target="_blank">art</a> </p>
      <p> She is fascinated with stained glass </p>
      <p> She is a pro-selfie </p>
      <p> Her first dvd ever was 'Big Trouble in Little China'</p>
      <p> She was kicked out of my home two days before of her 18th birthday and
        lived in a hotel and with friends for a couple of months until her dad
        got his first apartment. </p>
      <p> She was picked on a lot as a kid because she was weird looking and
        used to be very quiet and passive. The worst time happened on the bus,
        two loud and hairy sisters pull her hair and throw garbage at her.</p>
      <p> Her first time in a room with a computer was on January 6, 1975
        around 3:30 am at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.</p>
      <p> She went on a date with a guy she met at OkCupid.<p>
