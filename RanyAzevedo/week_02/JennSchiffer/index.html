      <h2> Who is Jenn??</h2>
      <p>Jenn thinks code, art, and jokes are a slam dunk, and tries to apply all
       three to her everyday life. She is the creator of <a href="make8bitart.com">Make8bitart</a>,
       amongst other code/art projects, and writes tech satire on a number of
       mediums. </p>

      <p>Before joining Bocoup, she was a senior front-end developer at the NBA
      and, before that, taught and evaluated computer science education at
      Montclair State University. She is the organizer of JerseyScript,
      a front-end developer meetup based in New Jersey â€“ one of several
      ventures she has become involved in to attract more people to the open
      web development community.</p>

      <p> When she is not building open web apps with web developers and clients
      she is making art with code, telling jokes, and getting yelled at on the
      Internet. Lately she has been focusing on making tools to teach and
      facilitate the creation and knowledge of art and code, speaking about
      and teaching web development all over the place, and trying to help
      others take themselves a little less seriously.</p>
