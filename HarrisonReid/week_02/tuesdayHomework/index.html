        <p>John von Neumann was probably one of the most intelligent humans to ever walk the earth. He made huge contributions to numerous areas of science, including but not limited to pure mathematics, physics, economics and computing.</p>

        <p>Von Neumann was born in Budapest, Hungary on December 28th 1903. From 1911 he attended the Fasori Evangelikus Gimnázium, an institution renowned for producing many high achieving intellectuals. By the age of 19 he had already published 2 major, and substantially influential mathematics papers. Following his completion of study at Fasori Evangelikus Gimnázium, he enrolled in study at two seperate universities - the University of Berlin, where he studied chemistry, and the Pázmány Péter University in Budapest, as a Ph.D candidate in mathematics.</p>

        <p>From this point on, he was basically a massive over achiever. I can't list all of his achievements here. But as evidence of how much this guy did, here's the list of the sub topics that he contributed to as per his Wikipedia page: Set theory, geometry, measure theory, ergodic theory, operator theory, lattice theory, mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, quantum logic, game theory, mathematical economics, linear programming, mathematical statistics, fluid dynamics. I don't even know what half of those things are. Over the course of his career, he published 150 papers. So far in my life, I have published no papers.</p>

        <p>Von Neumann's most widely recognised contribution to the field of computing is lending his name to the 'von Neumann Architecure'. This design was developed by those working on the ENIAC computer during WW2, and was to become the architecture of the classical computer - in which data an programs were encoded to the same memory, allowing one program to be treated as data by another program. This concept made the development of high level prgramming languages possible, and enabled most of the subsequent advances in software over the next 50 years.</p>

        <p>Another interesting period of von Neumann's life was his involvement in the Manhattan project during WW2. Due to his expertise in the dynamics of explosions, he was recruited to help design the explosive lenses used in the</p>
