        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <h2># 1</h2>
        <p>Yikihiro Matsumoto, also know as Matz, is married with four children.</p>

        <h2># 2</h2>
        <p>Matz began development of Ruby at the same time as Sun Microsystems developed Java. Ruby can not compete with Java in terms of functionality, but it does compete in terms of usabiliy. "I chose people", Matsumoto says.</p>

        <h2># 3</h2>
        <p>A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Matsumoto has completed standard service as a missionary. He now acts as a counselor in the bishopric in his church ward. In other words, he is a Mormon.</p>

        <h2># 3</h2>
        <p>Matz once said that "Some may say Ruby is a bad rip-off of Lisp or Smalltalk, and I admit that. But it is nicer to ordinary people."</p>

        <h2># 4</h2>
        <p>He believes that instead of focusing on focusing on optimising our code to suit the machines, "we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the
          slaves."</p>

        <h2>What does even Joel not know about??</h2>
        <p>In his younger years, he once had an

        <h2>OK for real this time.</h2>
        <p>Matsumoto is a common Japanese surname, meaning "base of the pine tree".</p>
