    <h2>The Early Years, 1894 - 1930s</h2>
    
    <p>Norbert Wiener was born in Columbia, Missouri, in 1894. His father was an able mathematician who had Norbit homeschooled until he was 9. In his autobiography Norbert described his father as a calm and patient man until he provided an incorrect answer, when his Father would lose his temper.</p>

    <p>Norbert finished high school at the age of eleven, and then graduated from Tufts College at the age of 16 with a BA in Mathematics, and was awarded a Ph.D from Harvard University at the age of 17 for his dissertation on mathematical logic.</p>

    <p>At America's entry into the First World War he attempted to enter the military as an officer, but was rejected due to his poor eyesight. In 1918 he joined the army as an enlisted man, but the war ended days after he was posted to his first assignment and he was discharged in 1919.</p>

    <p>After the First World War Norbert became an instructor of mathematics at MIT where he spent the remainder of his career, eventually rising to the position of professor.</p>
