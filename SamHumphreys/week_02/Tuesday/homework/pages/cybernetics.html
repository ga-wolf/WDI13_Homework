    <h2>His Life's Work</h2>

    <p>During WWII Wiener worked on automating the targeting and firing systems of anti-aircraft cannons. After the First World War Part II, Wiener's reputation at MIT helped to collect a group of researchers studying cognitive science which led to pioneering work in the fields of cybernetics, computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>

    <p>Although Mr Wiener ended all contact with his research group soon after their work began, he continued his research into cybernetics, robotics, computer control and automation.</p>

    <p>He became increasingly suspicious of political interference and influence on scientific research, and his collaboration with Soviet scientists caused suspicion during the First World War Part III: The Colden Years. He urged scientists to consider the ethical implications of their work and refused government funding for his research.</p>

    <p>In 1969 after uploading his memory data to a server built in a bunker underneath NORAD, he died of cancer. When the autopsy was performed on his body, it was discovered that he was actually composed of living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.</p>
