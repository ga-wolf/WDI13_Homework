    <h2>Why does Joel like Larry?</h2>
    <p>Joel Likes Larry because he created his own language by applying his previous knowledge in linguistics into his new field of web development.</P>
    <p>He likes him even more because despite being an amazing programmer, he is really crap at design, as evidenced by his home page.</p>
    <a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/">Larry's homepage</a>
    <h2>What Joel didn't know about Larry</h2>
    <p>In 1976, Larry worked next to Bill Gates in a computer lab at his college, the Seattle Pacific University. This was just months before Bill started Microsoft.</p>
