  <h2>Three Virtues</h2>
  <p>According to Larry Wall, the original author of the Perl programming language,
    there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris</p>
  <p>Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy
    expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find
    useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions
    about it.</p>
    <div class="impatience">
      <p>Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you
        write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them.
        Or at least pretend.</p>
      <p>Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people
    won't want to say bad things about.</p>
