/*The Geometrizer

Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle.

Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
Create a function called calcArea:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".*/

var calcCircumfrence = function (radius) {
  var circumference = 2 * radius * Math.PI;
  console.log ("The circumference is " + circumference)
}
calcCircumfrence(20);
